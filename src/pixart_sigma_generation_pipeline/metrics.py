"""Evaluation of generated images with a frozen CLIP scorer: prompt alignment, zero-shot label accuracy among
the dataset's captions, and similarity to the held-out real photographs of the same caption.

The scorer is the pinned `laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K` snapshot (MIT), loaded from its verified
directory; it never takes part in generation or training, so a change in these scores can only come from the
generator. Every number is a cosine similarity of L2-normalised CLIP embeddings (×100) or an accuracy derived
from one — tutorial sample-sanity evidence, not a benchmark, and not a human judgement of image quality.
